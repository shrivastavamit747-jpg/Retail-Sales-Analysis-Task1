# Retail Sales Performance Analysis
**Internship Task 1 - Future Interns**

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a retail sales dataset to uncover key business insights. The workflow includes data cleaning and exploratory analysis using **Python**, followed by the creation of an interactive dashboard in **Power BI** to visualize performance metrics.

## Tools Used
* **Python**: Used for data cleaning, date formatting, and trend validation (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
* **Power BI**: Used for creating an interactive business dashboard and demographic analysis.
* **GitHub**: Used for project documentation and version control.

## Key Business Insights
Based on the analysis of the dataset, the following insights were identified:

* **Total Revenue**: The business generated a total of **$456K** during the period.
* **Top Category**: **Electronics** is the leading revenue generator, contributing **$157K**, followed closely by Clothing at **$156K**.
* **Sales Trends**: A major sales peak occurs in **May ($53K)**, with a significant decline in **September ($24K)**.
* **Customer Demographics**: The average customer age is **41 years**, with **Males** contributing slightly more to total revenue (**51.06%**) than **Females** (**48.94%**).
* **Transaction Volume**: A total of **2,514 units** were sold across all product categories.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. **Seasonal Promotions**: The business should implement "Pre-Holiday" or "End-of-Summer" marketing campaigns in August to address the sales dip identified in September.
2. **Inventory Optimization**: Focus on maintaining high stock levels for the **Clothing** category, as it has the highest unit turnover (894 units) despite being second in total revenue.
3. **Targeted Advertising**: Since the gender split is nearly equal, growth can be achieved by targeting the slightly under-performing female demographic in the Electronics category.

## Repository Structure
* `Analysis_Notebook.ipynb`: Python notebook containing data cleaning and initial visualizations.
* `cleaned_retail_data_for_powerbi.csv`: The processed dataset used for the dashboard.
